# NFT Marketplace

## 🧾 Project Description
This project is a simple and minimal decentralized NFT Marketplace smart contract built on Solidity. It allows users to list their ERC-721 NFTs for sale and enables others to purchase them using ETH.

## 🌍 Project Vision
The goal of this NFT Marketplace is to create a decentralized, low-gas, and secure environment for trading NFTs without relying on a central authority. The marketplace emphasizes simplicity and accessibility, making NFT trading easy for everyone.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **List NFTs**: Any ERC-721 token holder can list their NFTs for sale.
- **Buy NFTs**: Users can purchase listed NFTs by paying the listed price in ETH.
- **On-Chain Transactions**: All listings and purchases are securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Auction Support**: Implement timed auctions and bidding functionality.
- **Royalties**: Add support for creator royalties on secondary sales.
- **Search and Filtering**: Build frontend integrations to search and filter NFTs by traits, price, and categories.
- **Multi-Token Support**: Enable trading with other token standards like ERC-1155 or allow payment with ERC-20 tokens.
